The two protocols are continuesly\r\nevolving and new features are added all the time. Cl√©ment Vasseur did [a\r\nfantastic job documenting](http://nto.github.io/AirPlay.html) most of\r\nthe two protocols in 2012, but since then a lot have happended.\r\n\r\nThis project is a first step in trying to fully uncover the two\r\nprotocols.\r\n\r\nEach new OS release for Apple TV and AirPort Express introduces slight\r\nchanges to the two protocols. So an important part of the reverse\r\nengineering is to get snapshots of how the different OS and hardware\r\ncombinations expose them selfs on the network.\r\n\r\nThis project does just that.\r\n\r\n### Important note about privacy\r\n\r\nInstalling an running this software on your computer will collect and\r\nsend information about all AirPlay and RAOP compatible devices on your\r\nnetwork **to a public database**.\r\n\r\nSee below if you'd like to know what kind of information is collected.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nThis is a Node.js module, so if you don't already have Node.js\r\ninstalled, [go ahead and do so first](http://nodejs.org/).\r\n\r\nThen run the following to install AirHarvest:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm install -g airharvest\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you are not comfortable with the command line, you can help by\r\ntelling your friends about this project instead.\r\n\r\n**Note:** This have not been tested on Windows and since it have binary\r\ndependencies, this might get tricky. Please open issues if you have any\r\nproblmes installing or running this software.\r\n\r\n## Run it!\r\n\r\nJust run the `airharvest` command from your command line :)\r\n\r\n## What does the collected data look like?\r\n\r\nThis is an example of what kind of RAOP data is collected:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"type\": \"raop\",\r\n    \"port\": 5000,\r\n    \"txt\": {\r\n        \"cn\": \"0,1,2,3\",\r\n        \"da\": \"true\",\r\n        \"et\": \"0,3,5\",\r\n        \"ft\": \"0x5A7FFFF7,0xE\",\r\n        \"md\": \"0,1,2\",\r\n        \"am\": \"AppleTV3,1\",\r\n        \"pk\": \"****************************************************************\",\r\n        \"sf\": \"0x44\",\r\n        \"tp\": \"UDP\",\r\n        \"vn\": \"65537\",\r\n        \"vs\": \"200.54\",\r\n        \"vv\": \"2\"\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is an example of what kind of AirPlay data is collected:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"type\": \"airplay\",\r\n    \"port\": 7000,\r\n    \"txt\": {\r\n        \"deviceid\": \"***\",\r\n        \"features\": \"0x5A7FFFF7,0xE\",\r\n        \"flags\": \"0x44\",\r\n        \"model\": \"AppleTV3,1\",\r\n        \"pk\": \"****************************************************************\",\r\n        \"srcvers\": \"200.54\",\r\n        \"vv\": \"2\"\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nMIT\r\n","google":"UA-53253056-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
